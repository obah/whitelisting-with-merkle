# MerkleAirdrop

---

The MerkleAirdrop project shows how to check wallet addresses for validity in an airdrop, add them to a whitelist for the airdrop and reward the addresses. It achieves this using a script [merkle.ts](https://github.com/obah/whitelisting-with-merkle/blob/main/scripts/merkle.ts)
